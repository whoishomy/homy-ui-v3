# Homy Healthcare Accessibility Manifest

## Our Vision

At Homy, we believe that accessible healthcare technology is not just a technical requirement—it's an ethical imperative. Our commitment to 100% accessibility is built into every layer of our architecture, from our code to our clinical insights.

## Core Principles

### 1. Universal Clinical Access

- Every clinical interface must be accessible to all healthcare providers
- Support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and assistive technologies
- High contrast modes for clinical data visualization
- Voice-enabled vital signs monitoring

### 2. Real-time Accessibility

- Live vital signs monitoring with audio feedback
- Critical alerts with multi-modal notifications (visual, audio, haptic)
- Keyboard shortcuts for rapid clinical response
- Screen reader optimized clinical insights

### 3. Cognitive Accessibility

- Clear, consistent clinical terminology
- Simplified vital signs presentation
- Step-by-step clinical workflow guidance
- Contextual help and documentation

## Technical Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AAA Compliance

- All components meet WCAG 2.1 Level AAA requirements
- Regular automated accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Manual testing with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
