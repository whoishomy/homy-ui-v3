# HOMY.MARS – QLLM Powered Interplanetary Health Governance

## Project Overview

HOMY.MARS is the world's first quantum-enhanced healthcare regulation engine designed for interplanetary missions. Using Quantum Large Language Models (QLLM), it autonomously generates, adapts, and evolves clinical regulations based on real-time telemetry data from astronauts on Mars.

## Problem & Solution

### Problem

There is no regulatory framework for human healthcare on Mars. Communication delays and environmental unknowns make traditional oversight infeasible.

### Solution

HOMY.MARS autonomously monitors health telemetry, interprets anomalies via QLLM, and generates real-time clinical protocols in JSON format, evolving with every intervention. It is the first blueprint for self-regulating health governance beyond Earth.

## Technical Stack

- **LLM Core:** GPT-4o + QLLM Kernel (Qiskit / Pennylane)
- **UI:** HOMY UI (React + Tailwind + CleanShot System)
- **Telemetry Engine:** Zustand + Custom Edge Layer
- **Regulation Engine:** AutoRegula (JSON Policy Generator + Telemetry Link)
- **Documentation:** Notion + CleanShot + Figma Pro
- **Video Demo:** mars-oxygen-crisis.mp4 (in progress)

## Demo Video: "Mars Oxygen Crisis"

**Duration:** 60-90 seconds

### Scenario:

1. Astronaut data streams into Telemetry Panel
2. QLLM activates, AutoRegula processes
3. JSON output generated and displayed in HOMY interface
4. Astronaut screen: "Protocol Accepted – Commence Assisted Oxygen Flow"

## Vision Statement

"We're not just solving a problem. We're writing the regulation of the unknown. HOMY.MARS is a vision of decentralized, quantum-powered health governance — for Mars, and for the next frontier."
